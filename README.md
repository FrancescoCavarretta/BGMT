This entry contains the source code used to run simulations of ventromedial thalamocortical neurons in in vivo-like conditions and process experimental data.
Simulations were implemented using the NEURON simulator, and the results were published in the paper (above).

The execution of these scripts requires NEURON v. 7.7+, Python v. 3.7+ along with SciPy, NumPy, PyNWB, and MatPlotLib packages.

For any question, do not hesitate to contact the authors.
